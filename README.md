# Weather App

![Workflow result](https://github.com/mamorenoa/challenge-compose-week4/workflows/Check/badge.svg)

## :scroll: Description

Full implementation of a weather app using Jetpack Compose, View Models, Coroutines and Hilt. 
There are two screens available: current weather and seven days forecast.
This app has been made for the fourth week challenge of #AndroidDevChallenge.

For making this amazing app, I get graphic resources from:

[FlatIcon](https://www.flaticon.es/)
[LottieFiles](https://lottiefiles.com/)

Weather data obtained from: 

[OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/api)

## :bulb: Motivation and Context

This time I have been focused in:
- Theming
- Layouts
- Architecture
